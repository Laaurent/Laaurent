# Hi, I'm Laurent 🏄🏼‍♂️

I am web developer from Paris, France. I've been creating web content with HTML, CSS since middle school, but it's only in the 2 past years that I've started seriously developing my skills and trying my hand at building complex, compelling projects with technologies like Laravel and VueJS.
I'm passionate about tech and visual things like digital projects.
